# This is AugustaOS

## Future Philosophy
This distro runs in absurdism, playful nihilism, and modularity. Requirements are guesses, architectures are opinions. So the sane move is to keep things small, loose, and swappable If nothing matters, you might as well enjoy your OS—and if you’re going to laugh at it, it should still boot reliably (probably).

## History
A friend of mine is a simp for this [video game character](https://wutheringwaves.fandom.com/wiki/Augusta). So, I though of making a cursor theme on it, but after seeing [this thing](https://github.com/ElysiaOS), I thought why not make a linux distro.

I dont know the ABC of making a linux distro so it will take a long time. Hope it finishes before Augustas next re-run.

Fyi, I dont play Wuthering Waves, but I know some things about it because my friend yaps about it so much.
