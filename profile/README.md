# This is AugustaOS

## History
A friend of mine is a simp for this [video game character](https://wutheringwaves.fandom.com/wiki/Augusta). So, I though of making a cursor theme on it, but after seeing [this thing](https://github.com/ElysiaOS), I thought why not make a linux distro.

I dont know the ABC of making a linux distro so it will take a long time. Hope it finishes before Augustas next re-run.

Fyi, I dont play Wuthering Waves, but I know some things about it because my friend yaps about it so much.
